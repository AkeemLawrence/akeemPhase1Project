This is the readMe for my Phase 1 Project. My application uses the Spotify API to return playlists, song data, or choose a radio station for the listener based on their preferences. I am choosing this API as Spotify is one of my favorite applications, and I would like to understand how it works!

The application involves using the Spotify developer documentation to get and return data from a public API.
